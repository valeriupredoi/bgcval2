"""
	This is a set of paths that is used by BGC_Val to locate various datasets.
	The idea is that it is set once per machine, and then used in multiple analyses.
	It also sets the paths for storing the post processed data. 
	
	The specific paths are:
	:shelvedir: A location for post processed data, saved in pythons shelve format.
	:esmvalFolder: A path for the model data.
	:ObsFolder: The base folder for many observational datasets. These will vary depending on your path location.
